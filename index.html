<h1>My 5 favorite dishes to cook for dinner</h1>
<h2 style"background-color:red;"This is a heading</h2>
<h3>Welcome to my website!<h/h3>
<h4>Cooking has become a passion of mine of mine over the last few years. It all started when I got my first apartment in the city after graduating undergrad. I had previously been living at home and didn't have to do much cooking. 
To learn how to cook I started watching episodes of "Top chief" and cooking videos on social media. I've made several dishes I've seen online and added my twist such as spices or seasoning. Since then I've gotten a lot better at cooking and no longer have to rely on videos online.
Below are my top five dishes to make for dinner with cooking instructions.</h4>

<h5>5. Pho<br> <br> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.
Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large stockpot and cover with 4 quarts of water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.
Place rice noodles in large bowl filled with room temperature water and allow to soak for 1 hour. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and after the noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water for 1 minute. Bring stock to a simmer.
Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Pour hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</h5>

<h7>3. baked ribs <br> <br> Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Mix ancho chile powder, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, cumin, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, and chipotle pepper in a small bowl until combined.
Place ribs meat-side down on aluminum foil. Prick back of rib rack several times with a knife.
Generously apply coating of dry rub to all sides of rib rack.
With rib rack meat-side down, fold foil around it to create a tight seal. Transfer to sheet pan.
Bake in preheated oven until tender and cooked through, about 2 hours. Remove and cool 15 minutes.
Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Open foil, drain and discard any accumulated juices and fat. Brush barbeque sauce on all sides of rack.
Place rack meat-side up and return to oven, leaving foil open. Bake for 10 minutes, remove from oven, and brush another layer of barbeque sauce on meat-side only. Repeat baking and brushing with sauce 4 more times, for a total of 50 minutes baking time.
Cut rack into individual rib segments and serve with more barbeque sauce.</h7><br><br><br>

<h8>2. Baked chicken<br> <br>
•	Preheat oven to 400°F | 200°C. Lightly grease a baking tray / sheet with oil and line with foil or parchment paper.
•	Combine the oil, honey, mustards, garlic, lemon juice and paprika in a small bowl to combine well.
•	Place the chicken onto the prepared baking sheet (tray). Season generously with salt and pepper. Spoon 3/4 of the honey mustard mixture evenly over the chicken and spread evenly all over each breast. Pour 1/4 cup water onto baking sheet to prevent burning, creating a sauce while baking.
•	Bake until cooked through (about 20-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts). Spoon the remaining sauce over each breast and broil (or grill) for a further 3-4 minutes on medium-high heat to brown the chicken and caramelise the edges. 
•	Cover with foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes to allow the juices to settle before serving.
•	Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

<h9>1. Pork chops<br><br>Preheat oven broiler (or grill) on medium-high heat. Season chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder just before cooking.

Heat oil in a pan or skillet over medium high heat until hot. Sear chops on both sides until golden and cooked through (about 4-5 minutes each side). Transfer to a plate; set aside.

Reduce heat to medium. Melt butter in the same pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Sauté garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water and vinegar. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thickens slightly (about 3-4 minutes), while stirring occasionally.

Add pork back into the pan, baste generously with the sauce and broil/grill for 1-2 minutes, or until edges are slightly charred.


Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.</h9><br><br><br>
